## 1. Print all even numbers from 0 – 10
Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.

## 3. Create a length converter function
Creating a function is a skill that’ll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you’ll be working on much more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in multiple professions and industries.

Let’s start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.

## 4. Calculate the sum of numbers within an array
You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem with a few different sets to verify your solution. Have one array with negative and positive numbers and another with integers and decimals.

You could also try using arrays of different lengths. If you’re feeling comfortable with this, try the slightly more challenging bonus challenge below.

Bonus intermediate challenge: Create a function that can return the sum of a particular column or row number in a table.
